# Record

Record is a relational object mapper (O / RM) that allows .NET developers to use a database using .NET objects. Eliminates the need for most to write those boring data access queries that developers usually have to write. It was born in 2006, but now we can consider it obsolete. Developed while I was at the University of Pisa, but now there are other more performing and updated ORMs than this small library, many years are passed when I written it. Thanks for reading.
